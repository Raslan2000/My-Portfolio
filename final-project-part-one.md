# Outline
For this project, I chose to focus on **Sustainable Fashion** because fashion is a big part of our lives and culture, but many people are unaware of sustainable practices. I want to start by highlighting our current situation in fashion and its impacts on the environment, followed by the effects of sustainable fashion, and concluding this project with a call to action.

1. **The Current Landscape**
2. **Consumer Shift: Towards Sustainable Fashion**
3. **Impact of Sustainable Practices**
4. **Conclusion and Call to Action**

## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# Method and medium
So for creating visualizations necessary for this story, I plan on using Tableau and for publishing the story on a page, I would use shorthand.
