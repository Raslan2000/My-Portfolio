# Outline
Fashion is not only about what we wear on a daily basis or about looking good. It is a medium to express our culture, values and ourselves. But with the rise of fashion, also rose the negative effects our environment, which is why I chose to do this project on **Sustainable Fashion**. 
By showing how moving to sustainable fashion, I hope to convince individuals to adopt a more environmentally conscious fashion lifestyle and therefore, saving the environment in style. This is how I want present my story:

1. **The Current Landscape :** Here I plan to show the highlight our current situtation of fashion and it impact on the environment
2. **Towards Sustainable Fashion :** In this we will explore how are companies tackling this and are they adopting the new sustainable practices
3. **Impact of Sustainable Fashion :** From here we will see has this led to more awareness among consumers to adopt sustainable fashion? Does this have a reduced  negative impact on the environment?
4. **Conclusion and Call to Action :** Based on the results, I will be provinding a recommendation based on sustainable fashion

## Initial sketches

From these rough skecthes I aim to tell my story of about how the fashion industry is harming the environment, how companies are reacting to it and in turn how is the general audience treating this.
# The data
From these datasets, I aim to create graphs that will show the adverse effect of the fashion industry on the environment, how the companies are acting on it, and how it affects consumer behavior.

# Method and medium
To tell this story, I plan on using Tableau to create the visualization necessary for this. For publishing and presenting the visualizations, I aim to use shorthand. With the combination of these two, I hope to tell a very convincing yet interesting story about how we can save the environment through fashion.
