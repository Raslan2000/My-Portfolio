# Changes made since Part II
Based on the user research and my own intuiotion, here are are some of the changes I made:
1. I changed the narrative to better help the audience understand wha highlight the point I am trying to make
2. Made sure each graph was clearly labelled and the legends were clearly labelled, so that the audience can understand completely whatâ€™s going on
3. Replaced the bubble chart from the 2nd visualization to a pie chart, show distinctly how much each segment covers
4. Added more KPIs and other details so that it caters more to the intended audience
5. Changed the moodbaord to match with the sustainability a bit more

## The audience
In this project for me, the target audience can be put under one umbrella: People influential in the fashion industry would include:

1. Business Executives: People in charge of the business within the fashion industry and people who make decisions for the business
2. Policy Makers: These are the people who frame the regulation and guidelines within a company
3. Business Leaders: These include Executives, Strategists and Consultants within the company who make recommendations to the business
4. Fashion Designers: Since some fashion designers also have a brand around them, they can incorporate some of these ideas into their designs

These are the kind of people I am catering to because these are the people who are more likely to make and implement changes within the fashion industry. 

Here is an example persona:
