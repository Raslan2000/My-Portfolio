# Wireframes / storyboards
Fashion is not only about what we wear on a daily basis or about looking good. It is a medium to express our culture, values and ourselves. But with the rise of fashion, also rose the negative effects our environment, which is why I chose to do this project on **Sustainable Fashion**. By showing how moving to sustainable fashion, I hope to convince individuals to adopt a more environmentally conscious fashion lifestyle and therefore, saving the environment in style.

The story would is structured that such that:

1. We understand the current situation: Where does the problem start? As mentioned earlier, the fashion industry is one of those popular industry that is causing harm to the environment and this need to be dealt with 
2. After the scene has been set, convincing proof is shown to fashion brands and companies to show that switching to sustainable fashion is actually beneficial for them. Hence, proposing a win-win deal.
3. Finally, a  case study is shown about a behemoth company who takes up it as a responsibility to be sustainable and still does well as a business, therefore banging the hammer on the nail and building a strong foundation that “even while running a business, you can be successful”

Then Finally, based on this I will propose a call to action and conclude the story. [Here is a preview of my story](https://preview.shorthand.com/N9WCBe9a7RNGgwsm).
