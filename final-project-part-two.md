# Wireframes / storyboards
business leaders, policy makers within the fashion industry, Fashion Brand Executives and fashion designers to switch to sustainable choices of clothing .



I will accomplish this by showing a series of visualizations which will serve as evidence as to "How is the fashion industry killing the environment" and "How Sustainable Fashion can still help be in the market?". These visualizations have been made using data sourced from Kaggle and Statista, where the primary means for the collection of the data is through surveys, SEC Fillings, their own market insights..etc
